## Usage

Describe how to run the program and any necessary steps to get it up and running.

## Features

- Provide a high-level overview of the main features of the project.

## Supported Algorithms

- Minimax Search: Describe the minimax search algorithm used in game theory and its purpose in the project.
- Alpha-Beta Pruning: Explain the alpha-beta search algorithm and how it improves efficiency in exploring the game tree.

## Heuristics

- Stability: Describe the concept of coin stability in Othello and how it is used as a heuristic. Explain the weights assigned to different categories of stability.
- Mobility: Explain the strategy of restricting the opponent's mobility and increasing one's own mobility. Differentiate between actual and potential mobility and describe how their heuristic values are calculated.
- Evaporation: Describe the evaporation strategy in the reverse game and its aim to reduce the opponent's available moves or liberties. Explain how having a lower count of discs can limit the opponent's liberties.

## Supported Game Modes

- Human vs Human: Explain how two human players can play against each other.
- Human vs AI Agent: Describe the mode where a human player can play against the AI agent.
- AI Agent vs AI Agent: Explain how the AI agents can play against each other.

## Difficulty Levels

- Maximum Difficulty Level: Describe the highest difficulty level supported, the depth used in the search algorithm, and its impact on gameplay.
- Easy Difficulty Level: Explain the lower difficulty level supported and the corresponding depth used.
